## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
cd road-sign-app
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Dataset Setup

### Option A: Folder-Based Dataset (Recommended)

Organize your dataset with numeric folder names:

```
dataset/
├── 0/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── 1/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   └── ...
├── 2/
└── ...
```

### Option B: Custom Label Mapping

Edit `label_mapping.json` to map numeric class IDs to sign names:

```json
{
  "0": "Stop",
  "1": "Speed Limit 40",
  "2": "Yield",
  ...
}
```

## 🎯 Training the Model

### 1. Prepare Dataset

Place your labeled dataset in the `dataset/` folder.

### 2. Run Training Script

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess images
- Split into train/validation/test sets
- Train CNN model with data augmentation
- Save best model to `model/model.h5`
- Generate confusion matrix and accuracy report

**Training Parameters:**
- Image size: 64x64
- Batch size: 32

- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Data augmentation: rotation, shift, zoom, brightness

## 🌐 Running the Application

### 1. Start Flask Server

```bash
python app.py

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Webcam Detection

1. Click **"Start Detection"** button
2. Allow camera access if prompted
3. Show traffic signs to the camera
4. Detected signs will be highlighted with bounding boxes
5. Click **"Speak"** to hear the last detected sign

### Image Upload

1. Click on **"Upload Image"** area
2. Select an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP)
3. Detection results will appear automatically
4. Click **"Speak"** to hear the detected sign

### Video Upload

1. Click on **"Upload Video"** area
2. Select a video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)
3. Click **"Start Detection"** to process the video
4. Detections will appear in real-time
5. Click **"Speak"** to hear detected signs

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
IMAGE_SIZE = 64              # Model input size
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.50  # Strong detection threshold
MIN_DISPLAY_CONFIDENCE = 0.25  # Show best guess for difficult images
FRAME_SKIP = 2               # Process every Nth frame
BATCH_SIZE = 32              # Training batch size
EPOCHS = 50                  # Training epochs
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `DATASET_PATH` – Override dataset path for training (default: `dataset/Train`)
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` – Max upload size in bytes (default: 200MB)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found

**Error**: `Model not found at model/model.h5`

**Solution**: Run `python train_model.py` to train the model first

### No Detections

**Possible causes**:
- Low confidence threshold (adjust in `config.py`)
- Poor lighting conditions
- Signs too small or far from camera
- Color-based detection not working (try different lighting)

### Camera Not Working

**Solution**: 
- Check camera permissions
- Ensure no other application is using the camera
- Try different camera index in `app.py` (change `source=0` to `source=1`)

### TTS Not Working

**Solution**:
- Ensure `pyttsx3` is installed correctly
- On Linux, install: `sudo apt install espeak`
- On Windows, ensure SAPI5 is available

## 📊 Model Performance

Expected performance metrics:
- **Validation Accuracy**: 85-95%
- **Test Accuracy**: 85-95%
- **Inference Speed**: 15-30 FPS (depending on hardware)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.80 (80%)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Uploaded files are stored in `uploads/` folder
- Consider implementing file size limits
- Validate file types before processing
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement user authentication for production use
